\section{Introduction}
A recent study by the U.S. Treasury Department found that traffic in the United States wasted 1.9 billion gallons of gas. Other studies have suggested that peoplein the United States spent as many as 5 billion hours in traffic, resulting in as much as \$100 billion in lost productivity.  spend and 5 billion hours of productivity in the past year.

Traffic jams form for a variety of reasons. Disturbances, such as traffic accidents, or road bottlenecks cause vehicles to slow down, causing the vehicles behind them to slow down and eventually leading to a wave of traffic traveling upstream of the disturbance. However, traffic jams are often observed to form spontaneously without any apparent disturbance. Even if a platoon of vehicles starts out equally spaced with all cars moving at the same velocity, it is impossible for all vehicles to maintain the exact same speed. In an ideal world, the vehicles can maintain this configuration indefinitely, but in the real world, vehicles may stray from their desired velocity, causing a disturbance in the uniform velocities and spacings. Under certain conditions, this disturbance becomes amplified and leads to a self-sustaining traffic jam. % What kinds of conditions?

In order to talk about stabilizing vehicular traffic, we have to first present an idealized model of traffic flow and then discuss the relevant notions of stability for the model. We model traffic as $n$ vehicles driving in a single lane, with vehicle 1 at the lead, vehicle 2 directly after, and so on. Following \cite{Peng}, we define the following relevant variables:

\begin{itemize}
\item $x_i$ - the position of vehicle $i$.
\item $v_i$ - the velocity of vehicle $i$.
\item $a_i$ - the acceleration of vehicle $i$.
\item $\mb x_i$ - the state of vehicle $i$.
\item $u_i$ - the control input to vehicle $i$.
\item $R_i$ - the distance $x_{i-1} - x_i$ in front of vehicle $i$.
\end{itemize}

As in \cite{Peng}, we conside vehicles with idealized dynamics as well as those that have servo-loop dynamics. In idealized dynamics, the acceleration $a_i$ instantaneously takes on the value of the control input $u_i$, giving dynamics
\[\dot{\mb x}_i = \left[\begin{array}{c} \dot{x}_i\\ \dot{v}_i \end{array} \right] = \left[\begin{array}{c} v_i\\ u_i \end{array} \right] =  \left[\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 1\\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] \left[\begin{array}{c} x_i\\ v_i \end{array} \right] +  \left[\begin{array}{c} 0\\ 1 \end{array} \right]u_i. \]

In this paper, we will focus on {\em string stability}.
